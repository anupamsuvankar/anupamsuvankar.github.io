  <h2><b>You always wanted a good you to propose</b></h2>

  <h6><i>This may not be the best way but its surely better</i></h6>

  <p>PETI</p>

  <br>
  <p>First of all I want to say that I am so lucky to have you in my life. I am thankful for every moment we spend together, and I wish our happiness never ends. I never miss a chance to say ‘I Love You’, coz I’m afraid that maybe one day I can’t say
    that to you and that will be my worst day of my life.</p>

  <hr>
  <p>You often say you are not perfect for me and I deserve better. You often say that you are immature and you are crazy and stupid, you mess up things. But to be honest, I love the way you are.</p>

  <hr>
  <p>And after all, all that matters is you make me happy. All your deeds, all your thoughts, even when you get angry and don’t talk to me for hours, when you fight with me, that makes me happy. So if you think that I’m going to leave you when I find
    someone better than you, you are wrong there. Coz I can’t be happier. And if you are still afraid that I’ll leave you some day, then don’t let me leave you. If you feel insecure, be more possessive, I don’t care. All I care is not leaving you.
    And when you say I deserve better, then you are that better person.</p>

  <hr>
  <p>And believe me, I love your immaturity. The way you act childish. I love correcting you when you talk childish, without even thinking.</p>

  <hr>
  <p>You always ask me to be possessive. I never want to be too possessive becoz I want you to enjoy your life. I want to learn from your mistakes. For me, the best way to make someone learn is to make them realize there mistake. And I trust you on
    that.</p>

  <hr>
  <p>Now all I can do is to thank God, thank every God there is or was or will be, that I have you in my life.</p>
  <p>Love you</p>
